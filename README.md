# Three-Tier DevSecOps Full-Stack Web Application Deployment on K8s using ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, and Jenkins

Three-tier DevSecOps project on kubernetes. It covers implementing CI/CD with Jenkins, managing GitOps with ArgoCD, deploying application on kubernetes cluster and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. 

+ Developed robust CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins to automate application build, test, security scan, and deployment workflows.
+ Implemented ArgoCD for declarative GitOps-based deployments, ensuring seamless and version- controlled application delivery to Kubernetes environments.
+ Embedded security early in the pipeline using Trivy for image scanning and SonarQube for code quality checks, ensuring compliance with security and coding standards before deployment.
+ Deployed and configured Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization of application and infrastructure health.
+ Designed and deployed a scalable and resilient Kubernetes cluster architecture for production workloads, supporting blue-green and rolling updates, high availability, and auto-scaling.
+ Managed application source code and infrastructure as code (IaC) enabling collaborative development and auditability
